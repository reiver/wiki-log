§ wiki-log

Application **wiki-log** creates a **log** for a specific date-time using the **wiki/1** file-format.

When year, month, and day it is depends on the location.
The **wiki-log** command has a command-line **--location** option so that you can specify the **location**.
For example:

	wiki-log --location=America/Vancouver

If no date-time is provided, then it defaults to the current-date-time.
The **wiki-log** command has a command-line **--when** option so that you can specify the **date-time**.

	wiki-log --when=2022-11-04T18:03:45

There is also a verbose mode that can be enabled with the command-line **-v** option.

❦

Likely you will either run **wiki-log** like this:

	wiki-log

... if you want to create a new log.

Or like this:

	wiki-log -v --location=America/Vancouver --when=2022-11-04T18:03:45

... if you want to create an old log.

Running that last comman would created the directory:

	log/2024/04/07

And would create the file:

	log/2024/04/07/1712510558.wiki

You would then edit that file.

§§ Format

The format of the path of the created file is:

	"log/" year "/" month "/" day "/" unix-time-stamp ".wiki"

(And remember that the 'year', 'month', and 'day' are depended on both the date-time and the location.)
